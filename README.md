Hi, Iâ€™m Max,
I am a computer science student interested in everything Linux and PC Hardware related.
I hope that in the future I will be competent enough so I can contribute to some open source projects,
but at the moment I will keep it at providing feedback to the projects I'm using.

Most of the stuff you will find here are personal configurations/small scripts I am using on my different PCs, feel free to use any of it for your own purposes.
