Hi, I'm Max, welcome to my Github profile.
I am a computer science student at [Technische Universit√§t Kaiserslautern](https://uni-kl.de/).  
My Passions include Rust, Gaming, Linux, Bonsai and more.  

Most of the stuff you will find here are personal projects so expect some bugs, or unfinished features.
